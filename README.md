### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ As a highly motivated and passionate software developer with 6+ years of experience, I have participated in all phases of software development. My expertise includes cutting-edge technologies like JavaScript (NodeJS, ReactJS, and React-Native), Elixir (Phoenix), and Solidity (EthersJs). I excel in parallel execution, networking, consensus protocols, and smart contract development. With strong soft skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, attention to detail, and a positive attitude, I exhibit an exemplary work ethic and willingness to learn processes and techniques quickly to enhance business and team efforts. My goal is to make a difference with each line of code.
